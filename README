Load test applet
================

The applet can be controlled by JavaScript to carry out a planned sequence of
GET requests (using multiple threads if necessary). It reports the time taken
for each request, and can indicate success/failure based on the presence of
a given regular expression.

I haven't really done proper documentation, sorry - it may help to look at
the example in the 'uses' folder, which uses the applet to load test the
popular PHP educational application 'Moodle'. For applet parameters, look
at the applet source. (Yes this is lame, sorry. If you need proper
documentation, pester me.)

This is released under GNU General Public License version 3. I didn't bother
doing the proper paperwork (header comments etc). If this is important because
you want to use it in part of another project, no problem, just let me know
and I'll sort it out.

Note:

Although I do work professionally on Moodle-related projects, this applet
and the accompanying Moodle report was developed entirely on my own time
at home.
