This is an admin report for Moodle 1.9. It tests simultaneous request
performance.

To use:

1. Copy the loadtest folder into the admin/report folder within your
   Moodle 1.9 installation.
   
   (Note: If looking at source repository, this folder may not contain the
   applet jar file loadtest.[build timestamp].jar. In that case, build the
   applet jar and place it in the loadtest folder too.)
   
2. Visit the /admin/ page within your Moodle installation in your browser.

3. Click the Reports menu. You should see a report called 'Load test'. Click
   this report.
   
4. You should see the report including the applet. Read the on-screen
   instructions and click 'Start test' to run the performance test.
